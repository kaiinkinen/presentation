# Stories from the trenches: A/B-testing

---

# Agenda

1. The System
2. The Problem
3. The 1st trial (and error)
4. The 2nd trial, with less error
5. The solution
6. Learnings


---

# The System
* All development on master
* Dev runs latest build
* QA gets manual upgrade with latest version
* Production gets build, which have been promoted.
* All configuration in chef

Usual architecture:
ELB - Apache - Tomcat - {lots of integrations}

---

## Pros:
* Rolling update, no downtime
* (Almost) Immutable servers
* Auto-scaling using AMI-images of the working service.
* Allows for _fast_ rollback

Achieved through switching between auto-scaling groups on the load balancer (ELB).

## Cons:
* Built on custom code. Learning curve is quite steep

---

# The problem
Test between two variants of the service.

Developing the variant by feature toggles or keeping both the versions in the code is bound to lead to messy code
* New development on a separate feature branch
* All the changes are "final", and old functionality can be deleted
* In case we don't want the new functionality, it can be discarded
  * Probably cheaper than to maintain two versions
  * Fewer moving parts and the code is production ready without major cleanup

Build both versions separately and deploy them somewhere.

---

# The 1st trial (and error)
! We have two auto-scaling groups, keep both and have the new version in one and the old in the other !

ELB round-robin between the groups, and session affinity to always keep the user on the same variant.

Always gives 1/2 and 1/2 between the versions. No way to control this ratio.

Experience has show that session affinity might break in spectacular fashion on upgrade.

But, the biggest drawback => **The System** gets broken
* No clear upgrade paths
* Downgrade is harder
* Introduces manual steps to an otherwise automated process

---

# The 2nd trial, with less error
Build nodes with both variants, LB between variant on node-to-node-basis
* Requires deterministic selection of variant
* Wish: Allow selecting the ratio between the traffic to the variants

Nginx to the rescue: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_split_clients_module.html

Take _some variable_, and hash it to 32-bit integer to select version

---
## Config
```nginx
http {
  upstream web-production {
     server localhost:8080 fail_timeout=0;
  }

  upstream web-beta {
     server localhost:18080 fail_timeout=0;
  }

  perl_set $nginx_req_rand 'sub { return int(rand(10000000)); }';

  map $cookie_a_b_rand $a_b_rand {
     default $cookie_a_b_rand;
     ''      $nginx_req_rand;
  }

  split_clients "${a_b_rand}" $variant {
     1.5%               "web-beta";
     *                  "web-production";
  }
  server {
    location / {
      add_header Set-Cookie a_b_rand=$a_b_rand;
      proxy_pass http://${variant};
    }
  }
}
```

# The solution
```nginx
http {
  perl_set $nginx_req_rand 'sub { return int(rand(10000000)); }';

  map $cookie_a_b_rand $a_b_rand {
    default $cookie_a_b_rand;
    ''      $nginx_req_rand;
  }

  split_clients "${a_b_rand}" $variant_no_override {
    0.01%              "web-beta";
    *                  "web-production";
  }
  server {
    # Repeated blocks for production/beta/delete cookie
    location = /cookie/variant/production {
      add_header Set-Cookie 'a_b_rand=production; Path=/';
      return 302 https://$host/;
    }

    location / {
      add_header Set-Cookie a_b_rand=$a_b_rand;
      proxy_pass http://${variant};
    }
  }
}
```

# The learnings
* Choose wisely what basis for the A/B-selection you use

* Keeping two variants of the code and libs in one place can be risky

* This approach requires some quite mature config and infrastructure

  * https://github.com/aptonic/ab.js/tree/master
  


1. Using e.g. the IP will lead to all people in some NATed network to end up in the same variant. We had that problem
at the customer, so it was a no-go for us. OTOH, using a session id will not really work, until you actually have one. Had we used JSessionid, as assigned by tomcat,
in our case, we would always ended on the same variant, as hash(empty) is constant.</sup></sup>

2. The variant from the branch must be renamed, or we can't guarantee that we're pulling in the correct version of the packages.
These can lead to hard-to-track bugs in the running system. Probably production, unless there's a lot of testing.
