# Stories from the trenches: A/B-testing

# Agenda

1. The System
2. The Problem
3. The 1st trial (and error)
4. The 2nd trial, with less error
5. The solution
6. Learnings


---

# The System
* All development on master
* Dev runs latest build
* QA gets manual upgrade with latest version
* Production gets build, which have been promoted.
* All configuration in chef
* Build, promote, deploy are all on Jenkins

Usual architecture:
ELB - Apache - Tomcat - {lots of integrations}

---

## Pros:
* Rolling update, no downtime
* (Almost) Immutable servers
* Auto-scaling using AMI-images of the working service.
* Allows for _fast_ rollback

Achieved through switching between auto-scaling groups on the load balancer (ELB).

## Cons:
* Built on custom code. Learning curve is quite steep

---

# The problem
Test between two variants of the service.

Alternatives:
1. Feature switches/toggles
1. Url-parameter, parsed on the service
1. Separate versions on current infrastructure
1. Separate versions, with separate infrastructure

---
# The problem
Test between two variants of the service.

Alternatives:
1. ~~Feature switches/toggles~~
1. ~~Url-parameter, parsed on the service~~
1. Separate versions on current infrastructure
1. ~~Separate versions, with separate infrastructure~~

Build both versions separately and deploy them somewhere.
* New development on a separate feature branch
* All the changes are "final", and old functionality can be deleted
* In case we don't want the new functionality, it can be discarded
  * Probably cheaper than to maintain two versions
  * Fewer moving parts and the code is production ready without major cleanup
* We were already _one step too far_

---

# The 1st trial (and error)
We have two auto-scaling groups, keep both and have the new version in one and the old in the other

ELB round-robin between the groups, and session affinity to always keep the user on the same variant.

Always gives 1/2 and 1/2 between the versions. No way to control this ratio.

Experience has show that session affinity might break in spectacular fashion

But, the biggest drawback => **The System** gets broken
* No clear upgrade paths
* Downgrade is harder
* Introduces manual steps to an otherwise automated process

---

# The 2nd trial. Less error
Build nodes with both variants, LB between variant on node-to-node-basis
* Requires deterministic selection of variant
* Wish: Allow selecting the ratio between the traffic to the variants

Nginx to the rescue: http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_split_clients_module.html

Take _some variable_, and hash it to 32-bit integer to select version

---
## Config
```nginx
http {
  upstream web-production {
     server localhost:8080 fail_timeout=0;
  }

  upstream web-beta {
     server localhost:18080 fail_timeout=0;
  }

  perl_set $nginx_req_rand 'sub { return int(rand(10000000)); }';

  map $cookie_a_b_rand $a_b_rand {
     default $cookie_a_b_rand;
     ''      $nginx_req_rand;
  }

  split_clients "${a_b_rand}" $variant {
     1.5%               "web-beta";
     *                  "web-production";
  }
  server {
    location / {
      add_header Set-Cookie a_b_rand=$a_b_rand;
      proxy_pass http://${variant};
    }
  }
}
```

---
# The solution
```nginx
http {
  perl_set $nginx_req_rand 'sub { return int(rand(10000000)); }';

  map $cookie_a_b_rand $a_b_rand {
     default $cookie_a_b_rand;
     ''      $nginx_req_rand;
  }

  split_clients "${a_b_rand}" $variant_no_override {
     0.01%              "web-beta";
     *                  "web-production";
  }

  # Allow override for the variant based on the cookie
  map $cookie_a_b_rand $variant {
     default        $variant_no_override;
     'production'   'web-production';
     'beta'         'web-beta';
  }
```
Cont'd
---
```nginx
  server {
    # Repeated blocks for production/beta/delete cookie
    location = /cookie/variant/production {
      add_header Set-Cookie 'a_b_rand=production; Path=/';
      return 302 https://$host/;
    }

    location / {
      add_header Set-Cookie a_b_rand=$a_b_rand;
      proxy_pass http://${variant};
    }
  }
}
```

# The learnings
* Changing from Apache to nginx on a mission critical system is not trivial :)
  * The details will come after you (A/B part: 4h, the rest 48h)

* Choose wisely what basis for the A/B-selection you use
  * IP-based split can skew the testing
  * Session-id is not present on the very first page-visit
  * Probabilities make testing difficult

* Keeping two variants of the code and libs in one place can be risky
  * Name with latest version can lead to mixed libs

* The shown approach requires some quite mature config and infrastructure
    * Paid services, like https://www.optimizely.com/
    * "Home-grown" https://github.com/aptonic/ab.js/tree/master

* This approach allows doing larger scale refactoring, e.g. tomcat -> node.js
